    <h2>
        <li>Workshop Summary</li>
    </h2>
    <p>
        This workshop is motivated by a fact: human beings have strong embodied intelligence in an open environment,
        but it is still challenging for large language models and LLM agents. Depsite some progresses on embodied AI
        on static and indoor environment, the LLM agents are still struggling in tasks in large-scale outdoor environment,
        such as navigation, search, spatial reasoning, task planning, etc. Therefore, we propose this workshop to discuss
        the recent advances on the related research area and looking forward to the future development. Specifically,
        it delves into topics of outdoor embodied intelligence, such as spatial intelligence and embodied perception,
        reasoning and planning, decision-making and action, multi-agent and human-agent collaboration, and the development
        of simulators, testbeds, datasets, and benchmarks. This comprehensive exploration of embodied LLM agents in open
        city environment holds the potential to advance the field of artificial intelligence and open up new applications
        in various domains.<i>We also have a special poster/short paper session for those solutions that perform best in
        the Open Urban Environment Embodied Intelligence Competition.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>We would like to discuss the following topics in this workshop:</strong>

    </ol>
    <h3>(6) Short paper / poster presentation for price winners of Open Urban Environment Embodied Intelligence Competition:</h3>
    <p>
        The organizer team have recently launched the competition with the benchmark platform named EmbodiedCity
        <a href="https://embodied-city.fiblab.net/" target="_blank">(https://embodied-city.fiblab.net/)</a>,
        a realistic, dynamic, and open platform for embodied intelligence,
        aimed at evaluating and researching its applications in complex urban scenarios. The benchmark consists of
        two components: a simulator and a dataset. The simulator is based on a large business district in Beijing,
        one of the largest cities in China, with 3D models of buildings, streets, greenery, statues, traffic flow, and
        other elements built using Unreal Engine 5. On the dataset side, we provide data and code for tasks related to
        multimodal scene understanding, question answering, dialogue, navigation, and task planning. The platform supports
        both online access and offline operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The competition on the EmbodiedCity platform focused on "Intelligent Urban Navigation and Interaction".
        Participants will be challenged to develop and optimize embodied agents for efficient navigation and
        multimodal interaction in complex urban environments. Tasks include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Urban navigation by aerial/ground agents,</li>
        <li>Multi-agent natural language dialogue,</li>
        <li>Completing designated tasks in diverse urban scenarios.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Outstanding participants will be featured in a special poster session showcasing the most advanced urban
        embodied agent designs and corresponding insights. The are also encouraged to submit the solution via a
        short paper (will be peer-reviewed before acceptance). The platform does not needs huge compuation power
        for partipants, which accords to one of original purposes: to encourage researchers who lack the computing
        power to publish long papers.
